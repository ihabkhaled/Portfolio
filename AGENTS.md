# AGENTS.md — Universal Agent Entrypoint

This repo is Ihab Khaled's personal portfolio and CV site, built on the strict Next.js frontend
engineering OS it started from ([NextRanger](https://github.com/ihabkhaled/NextRanger)). Every
architectural decision is enforced by a custom ESLint plugin (`eslint/architecture-plugin.mjs`),
typed strictly, and gated by tests. Your job as an agent is never to fight the guardrails: when a
rule blocks you, the code is in the wrong layer — move it, do not disable the rule.

## Read first, in this order

1. [.ai/BOOTSTRAP.md](.ai/BOOTSTRAP.md) — minimal-context loading protocol.
2. [context/ai-task-card.md](context/ai-task-card.md) — the low-token task router.
3. [context/architecture-map.md](context/architecture-map.md) — where everything lives.
4. [rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md](rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md) — the law.
5. The rule + skill matching your task (routing table below).
6. [memory/known-pitfalls.md](memory/known-pitfalls.md) — mistakes already made once.

## Non-negotiables digest

- Third-party packages are imported **only** through their owning wrapper in
  `src/packages/<vendor>` (ownership map: `eslint/package-boundaries.config.mjs`).
- Cross-module imports go **only** through the module public surface
  `@/modules/<feature>` (its `index.ts`). Deep imports across modules are banned.
- `*.component.tsx` files are TSX-only: no hooks, no logic, no inline declarations,
  no raw copy, no raw `className` outside the design system.
- Containers (`*.container.tsx`) carry `'use client'` plus a
  `// client-boundary-reason: …` comment, connect hooks to components, and own the `.map()`.
- No `process.env` outside `src/packages/env`; server env only via `@/packages/env/server`
  (guarded by `server-only`). No browser globals outside `src/packages/browser` / `src/packages/storage`.
- Query keys come only from builder files, never inlined at the call site. Use `useAppQuery` /
  `useAppMutation` from `@/packages/query`, never raw `@tanstack/react-query`
  (see `src/modules/contact/queries/contact.mutations.ts` for the mutation pattern this app
  currently uses — most data here is server-rendered and never reaches the client cache).
- Every user-visible string is a next-intl message key present in every catalog named by
  `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`.
  The only exception is `FALLBACK_ERROR_COPY` in the global error boundary.
- Page routes live in `src/app/[locale]` and APIs in `src/app/api`; navigate via locale-free `ROUTE_PATHS` plus
  `buildLocalizedPath` / `buildLocalizedLocation`
  (`src/shared/constants/route-paths.constants.ts`); client-side API calls (currently just the
  contact form) go through `httpClient` to same-origin `/api/*` routes — never a raw `fetch`.
- Lint runs with `--max-warnings=0`. Any `eslint-disable` requires a documented exception
  in [docs/exceptions/](docs/exceptions/README.md).
- TDD. Coverage: 95% global, 100% for utils/helpers/mappers/schemas/query-key builders.
  No `.only`, no skipped tests without a documented exception.
- Never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. CSP nonces come from `src/proxy.ts`; errors surface as
  message keys via `mapErrorToMessageKey`, never raw server messages.

## Validation commands

Run before declaring any task done:

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint 9 flat config, --max-warnings=0
npm run typecheck   # stable TypeScript 7 over app/test/node; prints compiler versions
npm run typecheck:compat # TypeScript 6 API compatibility check for ESLint/tooling
npm run test        # Vitest (npm run test:coverage for the coverage gate)
npm run build       # next build --turbopack
```

Aggregates: `npm run quality` (localized asset drift + lint + typecheck + coverage + build +
dead code + circular dependencies), `npm run gate:push` (format + quality + production audit),
and `npm run validate` (push gate + e2e + Trivy).
Run the two one-time, local Playwright steps once per environment before the first
`npm run validate`: `npm run test:e2e:install` (downloads the Chromium binary) and
`npm run test:e2e:baseline` (refreshes every current-OS visual snapshot; run only for an
intentional UI change and review each image).
The pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`) runs `npm run gate:push`; do not push red.
Commit each coherent behavior, design, test, or documentation concern separately with a
conventional message after its focused gate passes, then push the authorized branch promptly.
Never bypass hooks, mix unrelated concerns, or defer all publication to one final mega-commit.
